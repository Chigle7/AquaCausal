# WWTP-PCMCI
This study constructs and validates an innovative WWTP-PCMCI hybrid framework (Fig. 2), aimed at deeply understanding the complex causal mechanisms in wastewater treatment plant nitrogen removal processes. By seamlessly integrating deep learning architectures with a robust, time-aware PCMCI causal discovery algorithm and incorporating a multi-stage mechanism to eliminate spurious associations, this framework offers a novel and reliable approach to process understanding and optimization. We successfully generated and processed a disturbed dataset exhibiting realistic noise characteristics and robust structural integrity, confirming its reliability as a benchmark for evaluating causal discovery algorithms. Through the combination of PCMCI, L1 regularized Granger causality testing, and the MHSA-TCN with PFI method, causal networks were effectively identified and refined, eliminating redundant and spurious associations. Furthermore, a multi-dimensional robustness assessment (including DDA, CSR, RCC, and PT) rigorously validated the stability, directionality, interference resistance, and specificity of the identified causal relationships. Finally, based on stringent robustness criteria and PFI analysis, we reconstructed a sparse and highly interpretable nitrogen removal causal network , clearly elucidating the core driving pathways affecting effluent total nitrogen, precisely characterizing key nitrogen transformation chains, and quantitatively validating the time-lagged effects and strengths of critical process control variables. This research provides a solid theoretical foundation for precise prediction and optimized control of nitrogen removal processes under complex operational conditions.
